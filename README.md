# Power-Grid-Under-Uncertainty
MATLAB code to accompany "Optimisation of Power Grid Stability Under Uncertainty" accesible on [provide link].

This repository contains MATLAB code for running the simulated annealing under uncertainty algorithm which using the 'Simulated_Annealing_Under_Uncertainty_Sampling.m' scrip with the data specified in 'test_system_10_gen_distribution_uncertainty.m'.

The 'Lambda_Distribution_Linear.m' script is used to generate lambda versus quantile distributions for a specified level of uncertainty.

Note that the 'test_system_10_gen_distribution_uncertainty.m' is adapted from the data provided by [1] with uncertainty included in each parameter.
